Fun Story
----------
The following is the scenario. If you don't want to spend time reading
jump down to the specs.

You are a treasure hunter who stumbled upon a magic lamp. (Oh goody!)
You rub the lamp in an attempt to disprove the myth of the genie and 3 wishes.

Low and behold a genie emerges!

"Hello, hello, it is me! Wishes I grant is of count three!" the genie belts out.

He continues,
"Due to previous ambiguity and a few deaf genies there have been some changes.
First, your wish can't be spoken, but must be in written form. That way we actually grant what you want.
Second you must write down your wish again but backwards. The letters will still be forward facing.  
Then, and only then, do you rub the lamp and ask for that same wish."

"Sounds complicated", you retort.

Unbeknownst to you the new rules were not due to some mis-granted wishes. The true agenda was to inhibit people from requesting wishes.
The genii who pushed this into genie law were extremely lazy.

Fortunately, you have a laptop at hand.
If only you could write a program to reverse a string...
